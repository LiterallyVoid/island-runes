[radio] INCOMING CALL FROM: [Maya Exeter]…
@raise
[other] Is this thing on? Hello?
[me] Hello hello.
[other] I’ve been trying to call you for hours now! How’s your trip to New York going? Make some new friends?
[other] …
[other] I take it you’re not in New York.
[me] I just woke up on a deserted island. In the middle of nowhere.
[other] You’re joking.
[other] Okay, I think the friends thing has been ruled out. On the other hand, made any enemies recently?
[me] Hah, very funny. Uh, not that I know of. I might have broken the law once or twice. An hour. But that shouldn’t —
[other] Where does your communicator show you? It does have a GPS, right? It was like $5,000, it must have GPS.
[radio] COORDINATES: 999999° 59′59″N, 999999° 59′59″E
[me] …it’s not working.
[other] Just to be abundantly clear: you’re seriously stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere? You’re not joking?
[me] Right. Also, the ocean’s red. Maybe I should’ve led with that.
[other] Oookay. Does it taste like blood?
[me] Doesn’t taste like much of anything, to be honest.
