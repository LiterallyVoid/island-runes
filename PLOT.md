## DIALOGUE

[YOU] You used to know Douglas Exeter, right? What's his birthday?

[OTHER] December 19th, 2065.

[OTHER] Wait, was he on that ship?

[YOU] Yep. As a pilot, no less. I can't even get in---the keypad's not working right.

[OTHER] He said he'd retired.

[OTHER] By the way, if you're trying to break in, he'd never use his birthday for a passcode.

[YOU] Wow. That makes him better at cybersecurity than, like, everyone else on this ship.

[OTHER] Hah. No. He used the same passcode for everything: 10-8064. He even had it tattooed on his---

[YOU] Stop. I don't need to know, Honest.
